# Master's Thesis - Expanded Recipe EDSL and Recipe Scheduling

The original recipe EDSL can be found [here](https://github.com/Burtannia/recipe-dsl).

For my master's project the EDSL was expanded to handle recipes
which produced multiple outputs. The scheduling section was then
revisited and various methods were compared ranging from heuristic
based approaches to linear programming approaches which guaranteed
optimality.
